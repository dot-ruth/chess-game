# Chess-game with React

---

## The tools I'll be using

1. chess.js: a javascript library for chess move generation and validation
2. Material UI: a react component for building the app UI

3. react-chessboard: for rendering out the chess board

---

### creating the react app

`npx create-react-app`

---

### installing the dependencies ( chess.js, Material UI e.t.c )

`npm install react-chessboard chess.js socket.io-client @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`
